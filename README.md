# RaspberryPIDoc
My on-going project to collate all of the various peices of documentation around programming and developing low-level software on the RaspberryPi series of single board computers
<br>
<br>
<h2>Why are you making this?</h2>
<p>
Documentation on the RPI series is quite minimal. Although I was a fresh noob at the time, it took me over 10 hours to sort through documentation and figure out exactly how to get code running. Most of the documentation featured here is centered around low-level / bare metal development and will likely exclude documentation for development for system running Raspbian or the Linux Kernel. This may change in the future once the currently existing directories are properly filled with documentation. Having all of the documents in one place will help the RPI be an educational board and hopefully solve problems that would prevent those new to the RPI series get their first kernel / program running faster.
</p>
<p>
  Although currently very minimal - XMLs will be placed around the directory tree that provide an easy software interface for pulling information on the boards / other very easily. I have yet to put together a solid standard for how these should be structured so if you have ideas let me know! Otherwise, assume they will be mildly volatile for the time being.
